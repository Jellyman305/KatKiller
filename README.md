Kat-Killer
So this is a game that will probably be in development for a long time.

When it is done it will be released on our website (Which is under development itself).

You are welcome to fiddle with the code, but all we ask is that you let us know about any cool stuff you make and that you don't pass the game off as you own.

Finally, the current version you see here is nothing like what the final game will be, it is simple a test game that I made to check everything is working.
